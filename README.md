# Atom_JLCCPL
 Parts list file to JLCPPCB PCL File

Basically you export from EagleCAD schematic the Parts List and open it with this program like...

python ATOM_JLCCPL.py sample.txt

It will export on screen and in a CSV file the data needed. 


ALL PARTS SHOULD HAVE A VALUE. If not please put DNP on that line.. might change it to NA or what ever.
